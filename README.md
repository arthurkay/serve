# Serve

An HTTP web server for serving local directory files.

The app uses port 3000 by default, but can be changed to any alternative available port on the system.

The default directory to serve will also be the current working directory, but this too can be changed as shown below:

```bash

./serve -d /var/www/html/home-lab -p 8000


```
